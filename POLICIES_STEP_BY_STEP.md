```
âœ“ Users can upload screenshots       (INSERT - authenticated)
âœ“ Public can read screenshots         (SELECT - public)
âœ“ Users can update screenshots        (UPDATE - authenticated)
âœ“ Users can delete screenshots        (DELETE - authenticated)
```

## What Each Policy Does

### Policy 1 (INSERT - Users can upload)
- **Who**: Logged-in users
- **What**: Can upload new screenshots
- **Where**: Only to their own folder (`{userId}/...`)

### Policy 2 (SELECT - Public can read)
- **Who**: Anyone (even not logged in)
- **What**: Can view/download screenshots
- **Where**: All screenshots in the bucket

### Policy 3 (UPDATE - Users can update)
- **Who**: Logged-in users
- **What**: Can replace existing screenshots
- **Where**: Only their own screenshots

### Policy 4 (DELETE - Users can delete)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid expression" error
- Make sure you copied the expression **exactly** including all parentheses
- Check there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end
- Make sure you pasted into the correct field (USING vs WITH CHECK)

### Policy not showing up
- Refresh the page
- Check you clicked **Save Policy** (not just Review)

### Still getting permission errors
- Verify the bucket is set to **Public**
- Check all 4 policies are showing as enabled (green checkmark)
- Try uploading a test file manually via Dashboard

## Testing

After creating all policies, test by:

1. **Upload test**: Upload a file manually via Storage UI
2. **Access test**: Get the public URL and open in browser
3. **Generate project**: Create a new project and check if screenshot appears

If all works, you're done! ðŸŽ‰
